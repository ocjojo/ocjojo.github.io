## First Day<br>Wednesday 02.11.2016

My roommates arrived around 23:00, they are Hector from Mexico, Stefano from Italy and dutch Suzanna. They are really cool. While Hector and Stefano have been here for quite a while and are finishing their projects in the next weeks, Suzanna arrived two weeks ago and is starting in the same project as I am.

The first night was quite comfortable, even though there were some mosquitos trying to eat me. The repellant apparently did not work that great. I hope that is fine >.< Btw, I am staying in Hostel Cantinho do Brazil, so it is indeed a hostel :D

We got up quite early, as Elma - an AIESECe - wanted to meet us for the IPS.
Everyone offered me breakfast as I did not have time yet to buy myself. And off we go. Thank god I had Suzanna to tag along. She knew which bus to take to the meeting point (Marco Zero - for those that want to google), payed for everything as I didn't have reais (brazilian money) yet and told me some Dos & Don'ts. Riding the bus is a little different. You have to wave at a bus, if you want it to stop. The stations have names, but they are not written anywhere :D To get off you pull a line that spans from the front to the back under the roof of the bus. Unfortunately the busses have no display for the upcoming stations, you just have to know where you are. Sometimes the driver misses the signal and isn't stopping, so you have to yell something to indicate your whish to get off.

In the city we met Elma and she took us to get some Açai. This is kind of a national dish. It is made of the Açai fruit which is processed to something that is similar to slushees. You get it in a cup and can choose between different nuts and cereals to get in layers between the Açai slush.
It tastes really great, although I couldn't eat too much as it is very sugary/sweet.

For the next hours we got to know Elma and she told us about our project. Asked us how we would react in different situations that we might face, gave us tips on what to do, etc. Also it was a lot of fun.

Afterwards Suzanna and I met up with some friends of Suzanna. Karin another German doing a project here with AIESEC and Bianca a local brazilian. She was kind of showing us around :D She always told us that she'd be the worst brazilian as she didn't know anything herself. During the day different people met up with us and came along.

We visisted a small gallery with art of the last 30 years of a street artist named Ozi. His art is influenced by politics and expresses social issues, often through ironie. At least that is what I understood :D
We also were at Boa Vista Shopping Mal, where I did get a simcard, which is not working yet. And my first money. In the evening we went to a bar named Ramons.

During writing I noticed I probably will not want to write every small detail. So in the future I will probably write less often and hopefully more in depths on a specific topic instead of a report for a day.

If you want to know anything more specifically you can always ask ;-)
