## Departure/Arrival<br>Tuesday 01.11.2016

So today my 6 week travel/project in Brazil started. I am writing this from my dormroom of a hostel (I think it is one).
The flight was exhausting, but that was to be expected considering my preparation :D

As I am new to blogging feedback is welcome and appreciated.

----------

I am going to describe impressions and feelings that I had during the day:

- Monday 9:00 (yes, the day before) my alarm clock rings the first time. I still need to do some stuff, as I always postponed it during the last few days. (Online Checkin, organize english insurance confirmation, buy presents for my hosts and stuff for the Global Village, prepare some tasks for my project, finish tasks for the NIST, most importantly pack my stuff)
- But since I only went to bed at 6:30 I just knock it and sleep until 12:30. Then: lunch :D
- 13:30 it is clearly in the middle of the lunch break, so calling the insurance company makes no sense at all. Instead I should watch some Youtube Videos.
- 14:30 I call the insurance. Expecting to get an english confirmation of my travel insurance that I would need to send to Recife before tomorrow. Oddly enough that is no problem at all (how am I supposed to learn doing my stuff on time?).
- 16:30 (where did that time go?) my mum and I leave to go shopping. So at least I have the presents thingy covered.
- 19:00 back home, dinner time.
- 20:30 after an exhausting day, some definetely earned relaxing -_-
- 22:30 I should at least go over the stuff that Artur needs for his NIST tasks. Writing him, notice he is gaming, gaming myself .. wtf?!
- 2:30 (Tuesday) only one more game
- 3:30 should definetely watch Fynn Kliemann Videos and Rocketbeans.tv while packing
- 4:00 at last doing online check-in, packing, etc.
- 5:00 finished. nice, got plenty of time to sleep.
- 5:30 get up, shower, breakfast, check documents and boarding pass a 100 times over. Basically all that follows is in a weird state of anxiety and sleepiness.
- 6:10 leave for the airport. Thanks mum, dad, Aliyah and Madlen for bringing me.
- 8:10 given up luggage, 8:20 is boarding >.< (should have read up when boarding begins, instead of take off..)
- 9:15 I sit in my seat. 9:20 take off seems optimistic.
- 9:25 Announcement: some passengers are unexpectetly not flying with us. Their luggage has to be unloaded. This may take 15min at the longest - whaaat? creepyy..
- Take off. I was watching ... can't remember.. (3min later) ah, Tarzan. Was quite good. Different than expected. Kind of slept through "The Martian" and most of the flight.
<br>Small annoyance: The passenger behind me took his shoes off.. did not check if it was a man or a woman to not make him/her uncomfortable.
Guy in front of me was a giant. When he sat down his seat came at me and made my 83cm room for feet half of that.
- Landing: watched "Finding Dori" for the last part of the flight. Got cut off 8min before the ending because I had to leave the plane.
- It is warm :D yeaah 30Â°C.
Standing with anxiety in the queue for the passport control as I somehow overslept the distribution of these arrival note thingies. And they are nowhere to be found in the arrival area.. 
<br>Border control had them. No problem at all.

## Arrival

After getting my luggage I was basically an hour late. Getting the free wifi to work, I learned that Claudio already left after waiting for me for an eternity. (I am so sorry for that >.<). But he was coming back. No problem at all, just felt bad for him.

### Meanwhile, my brain:

The clishees and stories have their effect.
Just read a few days ago (on the internet, so it must be true) that during the time of the syrian war less people died than in street violence in brazil during the same time. What the .. ?! And I went there? willingly?
<br>To be fair, and I just now read that up: Brazil has a population of 200 Million, while Syria has around 16 Million (22 Million pre-war).
Also there are supposedly a lot of muggings and kidnappings. Basically I am in the middle of anarchy.

Good thing I am getting picked up by AIESECers, so I will be save.
Or will I? I have never seen their faces. Any random guy could pick me up and I would go with him without resisting. Easiest kidnapping ever.
Ah, wait. How would any random guy have my number? I am save, probably.
Couldn't shake the feeling completly. How pessimistic can I be?

### Back to reality:
**Claudio is the nicest brazilian I have met yet**. He came there to pick me up. Two times. Although his car broke down (if I understood correctly).
He got 3 other friends with a car to pick me up with him. And we drove to this hostel (still not sure yet :D).

The car ride was awesome and kind of awkward at the same time. They mostly spoke portuguese. Funny enough I forgot every word of portuguese I learned during the last 3 month. Or at least I didn't understand anything except for occasional words. Knowing vocabulary and speaking a language, of course, are seperate things.

Still seeing Brazil - part of Recife - for the first time was great.
Noticing all the things that are different. Quality of streets and houses seem lower than in Germany. Kids playing in the streets. People at the side of the road offering drinks and snacks. Later Claudio and one of his friends, whose name I can't remember, but would not be able to spell or pronounce anyway, bought some. It is called "Pipoco" and is sweet Popcorn. Although it is a little bit different than "our" Popcorn. It reminded me of cookie crisps (breakfast cereals) without the chocolate. My first brazilian food.

Brazilians drive differently. Compared to germans you could say "nuts" :D
<br>But I still felt very save. Just would not want to drive myself.
The way Brazilians interact is more lively, glowingly - at least I would say that at the moment. At the airport people were chatting with the border control officers and other personell.
And in the streets it is more than just going from one place to another. There is live.

So I was dropped off at this venue. Where I have a dormroom. There is a kitchen and .. well. Most of you know hostels. ^^ 
<br>But we also have a pool. How awesome is that?
<br>My roommates are 2 italians and a girl from the netherlands. All here with AIESEC. Haven't met them yet.

To summarize: Everything went well. It was exhausting mostly because of my unsubstantiated anxiety. **It is really great having someone (or a group of people) that did all the organizing for me**.

Tomorrow we will have the Incomer Preparation Seminar. Very excited to get insights and must-knows for living in Brazil.

Write you soon.
