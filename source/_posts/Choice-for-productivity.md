## Choice for productivity

There are many things fighting for my attention throughout the day. To be productive I have to somehow reduce the distractions from my current focus of work. That simple.

There are a lot of resources containing research, advice and methods for productivity. This is just a list of *my* common pitfalls.

In my experience there are different kinds of productivity killers:

### The classics a.k.a. procrastination

- Websites: 9gag, Hacker News, Feedly, Twitter
- Social Media/Chat: WhatsApp(Web), Facebook
- Media: Youtube, Netflix,..

Being real about it - I know that I procrastinate when visiting/doing those.

To be more productive there are 2 choices:

- get iron discipline not to do those while working.
- avoid the distractions in the first place. E.g. phone on silent, block/close the sites in question for a *specific* period of time.

For me the second seems to be a lot more doable :D In my experience the time needs to be limited, as not to have thoughts like: "I need to check eventually, maybe something important/urgent has happened".

It needs to be long enough that you can get something done in between, but short enough, that you will not miss anything important.
In my life that depends on the day of the week, as well as the time of day and ranges anywhere between 25 minutes to 2.5 hours.

Personally I use pomodoro to do this. Block out everything for the time of a sprint. Check the phone in short breaks, people call in urgent cases. Check emails/messages when I feel like it, just not every break. You'll notice *the world goes on without you replying to every message within minutes*.

### pseudo productivity a.k.a. unfocused activity

Often I follow the advice from above and have a feeling of being productive. But looking back, I am disappointed by what I have actually achieved.

I think this stems from unfocused activity. *Just doing is not enough*
Do tasks that you know are contributing to the endgoal.
I have no real advice here. It takes a lot of experience and trial&error to get a feeling for what will actually contribute and what is just random activity.
So don't feel bad at the end of the day, if you look back and have not achieved what you set out to.
**BUT** take the time to reflect about the reasons, *why* you have not been able to achieve your goals.

My common unfocused activity thingys:

- premature optimization. I waste a lot - really **a lot** - of time thinking about wether I am doing things the best, fastest and/or most future proof way I can. Quite often this wastes more time than it saves. Take some time to thing about a way of doing something and then **follow through**. Just get it done. Force yourself to do optimization *only* if you are finished and not satisfied or you are stuck.
- not asking. When optimizing I also waste a lot of time researching and learning about things. While this makes me more knowledgable in the long run, quite often my current problem could be solved *much faster* by just asking affected persons or someone experienced in the concerned area. (Also making me more knowledgable).
- not delegating. Doing things myself, that others could or even are supposed to do. I don't have that much experience in this area yet, but I think it takes a lot of trust, to let others do things for you. If you check afterwards if they have done it the way you wanted and/or fine-tune it yourself. It will not save you time. Also most people do not mind doing things for you, *if* they can make sense of it. Don't think too much about wether you should be delegating. Just do it. If people are not happy with it, they will let you know ;)

The problem here is - more often than not - I am not even noticing I am doing these. I just think it is necessary to fulfill my task.

Pomodoro also helps me to prevent this. It forces me to take breaks and thereby gives me time to just stop and think if I am *really* doing the most straight forward thing to solve my task.

*But* just having the time, doesn't actually make me think about it. So try to remind yourself, by setting up visual clues, a reminder somewhere or whatever.
